    "First, I dropped the undefined 0 column because it didn't hold any valuable information. I then changed all of the columns into lowercase, removed punctuation and spacing, and turned them into snake case. After that I worked on changing the data types. I changed the price data type into a float because I had changed it so it didn't have a dollar sign or commas so it made the most sense as a float. I then changed the id and zipcode data types into strings because although they were numbers I was not going to use them numerically. I then changed the date data type to datetime and removed the empty timestamps. I then worked to treat the missing values. I changed the missing values to the mean value when I was working with numerical data, and then I changed the missing values to mode when I was working with categorical data. I dropped the year renovated column because there were too many missing values for it to be useful data. I then dropped the remaining rows that had missing values. I then treated the outliers by removing rows that did not fit into an appropriate zscore threshold. "
